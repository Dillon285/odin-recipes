        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This salad features super-fresh flavours and great textures, perfect for when you are a bit over hearty meats and want something
            light yet fulfilling. The combination of plump prawns, sweet apple, crunch cabbage and vibrant herbs all combed with the richness
            of a lime coconut dressing is amazing.
        </p>
        <p>Originally this recipe was sourced from the great woman Recipetineats who has quite a wealth of good recipes to follow.
            I've imported this recipe into this page as the link only has a how-to video guide, no actual recipe. This is because this
            recipe is a cookbook exclusive recipe but I don't gatekeep so I've translated the video into the recipe below.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The dressings arn't a necessity, use if you have</li>
            <li>I found for two people half of half of a cabbage is enough (so a quarter)</li>
            <li>Is a salad with quite an amount of texture, leaning on the fibrous side</li>
            <li>Depending on which part of the cabbage you cut will impact the crunchyness of the salad</li>
        </ul>
