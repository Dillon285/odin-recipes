        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This popular pork belly dish know as Hong Shao Rou is known in English as Red Braised Pork Belly. Pork belly chunks are braised
            over a long period of time with soy sauce, rice wine, sugar and spices to create a complex taste that ensures the skin and fat
            melts easily in your mouth without it becoming gelatinous.
