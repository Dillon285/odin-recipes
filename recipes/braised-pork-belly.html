        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This popular pork belly dish know as Hong Shao Rou is known in English as Red Braised Pork Belly. Pork belly chunks are braised
            over a long period of time with soy sauce, rice wine, sugar and spices to create a complex taste that ensures the skin and fat
            melts easily in your mouth without it becoming gelatinous.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe has been taken from the wonderful people at "Red House Spice". Unfortunately their site has much too many ads for it
            to be readable especially for smaller screen sizes. I have thus transported the recipe onto this page to create a more simplified
            page.
